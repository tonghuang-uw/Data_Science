# Data_Science

This is a collection of notes exploring a number of topics and projects in Data Science. The idea is to use Python to illustrate the theoretical concepts and showcase my projects.

## Fraud Detection

The goal of this project is to build models that can predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The project involves the use of three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, SVM and a Neural Network for this task.

## Deep Learning From Scratch

This project builds deep learning model from scratch and apply them for churn prediction. The comparative analysis of different algorithm is provided.
